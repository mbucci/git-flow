## git-flow

in this repo I will experiment with git workflows

### PRs

1. develop work on a PR branch (e.g. mb/first-PR) 
2. Create at PR of the PR branch into `master`
3. "Squash and Merge" the PR once approved


### Releases

1. Create a PR of `master` into `production`
2. Fast-Forward merge from the CLI
3. DO NOT USE GITHUB TO MERGE THE PR! (merging on the command line will close the PR)
4. Tag the release commit
